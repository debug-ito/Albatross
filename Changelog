Uguiss-2.00    2016-04-29
               Version 2.00 is designed for Xubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus).
               
               [gtk-2]
               - Fix color settings for column-header (or sometimes called treeview-header).
               - Set styles for "tabwin", the window switcher for Xfce4.
                 In Uguiss, the key cursor is highlighted over the mouse cursor.
                 Otherwise, it would be so confusing.
               [gtk-3]
               - Fix assets for checkboxes and radio buttons.
               - Fix .overshoot style (an effect you get when you try to scroll further than the limit)
               - Fix .undershoot style (an effect you get when the window is positioned in the middle
                 of the entire document)
               - Fix .spinner style.
               - Fix .progressbar style. Its color setting disturbs the label.
               - Fix column-header style.
               - Improve .sidebar style.
               - Fix .xfce4-panel style.
                 -gtk-gradient is replaced with linear-gradient because the former somehow hogs CPU.
               - Fix .toolbar and .inline-toolbar style.
               - Improve .titlebar style.
                 Now (hopefully) the title buttons are clickable at edges of the screen when the window
                 is maximized.
               - Fix .window-frame style.
                 It has no shadow but has a solid frame, in both composite and non-composite modes.

               [gtk-3]
               - Now progressbars are drawn by pure CSS.
                 It can now adapt to different sizes of bars.
               [gtk-2]
               - Fix the bug in which check/radio in menuitems were not visible
                 in libreoffice.
               [license]
               - Now Uguiss is under GPLv3 because of the code borrowed from
                 Clearlooks-Phenix.
